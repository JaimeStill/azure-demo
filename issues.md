# Issues

Things that I need to look into resolving:

* Device Code Login Flow:
    * Trying to integrate Device Code Flow from within a CLI using the following has yielded no results.
    * [MSAL Device Code Flow](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Device-Code-Flow)
    * [Azure Samples Device Code Flow](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-devicecodeflow-v2/tree/main)
    * [Authentication Flow Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows#device-code)
    * [Acquire a token using Device Code flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-desktop-acquire-token-device-code-flow?tabs=dotnet)
